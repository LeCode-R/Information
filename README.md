> **Less Code, More Results** - Transform Research Papers into Production-Ready Code

Welcome to **LeCode-R**, where cutting-edge AI meets practical research reproduction. We're building the next generation of paper-to-code tools that make academic research immediately implementable.

## 🎯 Mission
Eliminate the 60% of research time wasted on code reproduction and environment setup. Enable researchers to focus on innovation, not implementation debugging.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

### [LeCodeR Platform](./lecoder-platform) 
A modern TypeScript/Next.js rebuild of research paper reproduction tools, featuring:
- 📄 **Paper-to-Code**: Upload PDF → Get working repository
- 🖥️ **Dual Interface**: Both GUI and CLI experiences  
- 🔑 **BYOK Support**: Bring your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- ⚡ **10-minute turnaround**: From paper upload to downloadable zip

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase, Vercel AI SDK

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for seamless tool communication
